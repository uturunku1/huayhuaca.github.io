Cold Call Game was inspired by my friends who work as brokers/underwriters. They need to make cold calls in order to get new agents and accounts, but they constantly get discourage whenever they get a rejection . This web app is a CRM that motivates the user to make cold calls because it is a fun, not a tedious, process. Every call, depending of its results, is a number of points. Every 70 points the boss takes you out for lunch!

I built a different [version](https://github.com/uturunku1/drupal-cold-call) with PHP and Drupal. It can also be found in here: http://live-cold-call.pantheonsite.io/
