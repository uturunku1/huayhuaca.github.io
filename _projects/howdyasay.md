I created this learning aid app motivated by a personal need.
Here the user gets to customize the sentences/phrases he wants to learn in another language by sending a url request to a “teacher,” who can be a formal language teacher, friend, relative, or acquaintance who speaks the target language. The teacher then records an audio saying the phrase requested by the user and would not need an account to do so. The teacher would simply follow the url, which will take her to a page to record herself. All the audios saved would go into the user’s app archive and would be organized by dates or categories such as, “Mother-in-law questions”, “Pick-up lines”, “curse words/expressions”. The user can review those audios at any time. This app is intended to replace boring audio tapes or language laboratories that only focus on making you “repeat-after” popular, “well-established” vocabulary that you may never even use. This app allows you to mimic phrases that are specific to your needs and that you are motivated to learn.
