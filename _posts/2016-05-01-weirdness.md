title: On Portland's Weirdness
excerpt_separator: "<!--/excerpt-->"

As an expat that comes from a big city (I grew up in Lima), Portland, Oregon seems so small and quiet. People that live here keep telling me how fast is growing, and indeed, in my 4 years living here I’ve noticed the changes. Still, it seems that my longest drive will be roughly 30 minutes, and not even on the warmest day on the summer, in the middle of downtown, I have the need to step aside to share the sidewalk with others. Is great.

Is Portland weird? I can’t really tell since everything in this country, in general, is still sort of weird and new to me. It fascinates me when the locals go out to the parks on a sunny day, shirtless or in their bathing suit to take sun bathes for hours on end. They are the picture of happiness and there should postcards of it. If I approach the locals to ask, say for directions or the name of their puppy, their eyes will brighten up and a big smile will appear on their faces, while they expand on their answer for as long as they can. Is like time doesn’t pass for them and they're looking to make friends. I envy small-town attitude.

I love how peaceful Portland is, not just because how slow life moves here, but how people prefer bikes than cars, hikes than bar hopping, and how much green I’m surrounded by. Portland has the smallest and the biggest park in the US within city limits, look it up. I can’t count how many times I have stopped to take my picture with some rare flower or tree. Though, I must admit I loose that serene attitude when I’m behind a slow group of bikers, the brewcycle or the streetcar, BUT, you gotta respect their culture.

Is Portland very white? I guess there is a lot of Caucasian locals fellows out there. Even more if all those white immigrants from Mexico and Middle east where to be consider in the demographics. But one the fascinating facts I learned in this country is that white and immigrant are two words that contradict each other.

What I like best about the looks of the locals is their clothing. Is so exotic and multifaceted. Some tight jeans, modest t-shirt and interesting looking hat seems like it works in any kind of environment, office, Friday night, fancy restaurant, you name it. And when it rains, which happens a lot, people don’t use umbrellas, they just get wet and don’t care how they look. They’re humble.

So many other things that I find captivating about this country, but I’ll leave it for later. I’m learning to embrace the “no rush, chill out” attitude to, someday, pass by a native.
