title: On Coding Bootcamps

It has been a long time since my last post. The main reason was that I joined a coding [school](https://epicodus.com)  in January and graduated last month. These schools, also called bootcamps, are famous for training students to quickly learn major tools for software development. Students, it has been said, typically get a job placement within 3 months of graduation.

Since moving to the US, my most successful job has been as Medical Interpreter. It is a wonderful career to have. Nevertheless, I was looking to expand my skills and clearly, knowing how to code these days is one of the most profitable and in-demand skill sets to avoid being left behind in this tech driven world.Without a doubt, I feel that this six-month program was one of the most mind opening and useful experiences that I have ever been exposed to in my life.

In the beginning, I was looking to join an all-female coding bootcamp, yet I ended up in mixed one. I have heard that female bootcamps are great for intellectual and emotional support. There a sense of solidarity and understanding amongst your female peers that helps all of them to move forward together. I'd have loved to have that feeling. However, I am certain that I got other benefits out of my bootcamp that, perhaps, I would have not get from an all-female bootcamp.

My male classmates (most of my class) were talented programmers, many having experience even before school started. This kept me competitive (in a good way) and motivated to learn fast to be at the same level with them. My female classmates were also extremely talented, but I believe all of us ladies, had have not much previous experience at coding. Also having a mixed-gender group helped create a wonderfully diverse environment of thoughts and interesting discussions.

The fact that we started with 41 students and 11 had dropped out by the end of the program, is a testament to the passion and perseverance of my peers, and it makes me proud to have made it to the end.

Quick demographic facts: Of those 30 students, 3 where foreigners and 6 were women, 2 non-caucasians. I was the only women of color. A minority among minorities. How does that feel? Mostly, like anybody else. I was surprised how much closer, rather than different, I felt towards my classmates. We were all there moved by similar motivations and all nervous and excited to be in this new phase of our lives. A few times, the ladies and I joked about the boys being a little condescending towards us and hovering over the mouse. However, none of these thoughts created resentment, but rather a sort of desire to be more proactive when pair-programming.

I am curious to see how the real world will treat us, but I tend to believe that this was a micro cosmos of things to come ahead. Which means we are very well prepared for things like peer-group communication, diversity of thought, and learning new tools in a blink of an eye. `Dear reader`, even if you are not looking to work in software, consider a coding bootcamp. What you will learn will be invaluable for any position you hold AND you will never see an electronic device and the internet the same way. It will be like looking at a book for the first time and finally knowing what all those printed characters mean.
