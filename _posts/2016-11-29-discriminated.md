title: Have you been discriminated against?
excerpt_separator: "<!--/excerpt-->"
---

That is the question that my father-in-law asked me one day by surprise. I loved his question. I had been living in the US for over 4 years and so far nobody had cared to ask my opinion on this matter. My father-in-law had been auditing classes since he retired and this same question was asked in one his courses in which they had been discussing the subject of racism and discrimination in Portland. Many of the students had said that, indeed, they had suffered from open racism in this small, charming city. My father-in-law was very curious to get my input on this because, after all, I am an *indigenous* woman and a minority in this country.

My answer was a very well thought out "no." Maybe I got lucky all this time, but honestly, so far I had never been mistreated or had experienced discrimination (at least not to my face). I've been treated differently, certainly, but I'd say only in a good way. Americans from all colors of the spectrum recognize me as a non-white foreigner and have given me special, positive attention because of it. For instance, they are often curious to find out where my accent is from. They want to hear all about my country and listen to my opinion (perhaps to enrich their perspective of things.) To go further, I'd say that even when it comes to sexuality, I have also experienced favoritism. We ought to recognize that there are men out there that like "different", specifically if "different" means a petite women with black, straight hair/dark features. Now, don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean that I don't believe in discrimination against certain races. Of course I believe it when I hear about cases of black people or non-white Mexicans being profiled by authorities, Asian-Americans being stereotyped and anti-Semitic movements reappearing and making their presence clear in websites like the Daily Stormer and Stormfront.

Probably one of the reasons I haven't found myself in this situation is due to my location. I chose Portland, Oregon as my home. One of the most quiet, friendly, well-educated states in America. Interestingly enough, it is also one of the places with the greatest history of racism and neo-Nazism. However, here I have surrounded myself with intelligent, cosmopolitan people, who would never consider me less because of my looks. I'm sure my story would be different if I was living in the middle of the country, amongst modest people with less education.

However, my life hasn't always been free of discrimination. Back in Peru, I was a victim of subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, discrimination. If you think that the US is bad in terms of racism, I'm ashamed to say that Peru makes US look like a bunch of timid, Japanese schoolgirls. Peru is a diverse country. We didn't do such a good job killing all of those indigenous people, like the English settlers did here. For that reason, we always had constant, tense interactions of whites and the large non-white population (mixed-race, Asian, black, indigenous, etc.). Add to that the many different levels of social classes living together in one city, Lima, and this makes our society a battleground of whom looks down on whom. Among Peruvians, we had this saying: "The white looks down on the cholo (mixed-race Peruvian), the cholo looks down on the indio (Peru's First Nation), the indio looks down the negro, and the negro looks down on the chino (Asian man)." I was lucky to grow up in a middle to upper-middle class society, where I didn't have a shortage of opportunities. Nonetheless, social class does not make up for my race. I was still a little, Andean girl among other Limenians of lighter skin or more caucasian features, who, under certain circumstances, got better treatment than me. To give you a more concrete illustration of how racism works in Peru, I'll make a list of situations when I felt hurt or felt that being non-white was a bad thing:

-When kids made fun of very indigenous last names like mine.
-When I went to a party where all teenagers were blonde and someone said "where did Pocahontas come from?"
-When Peruvian television uses blackface for comedy.
-When your relatives or friends of relatives complement someone's kid for being blonde and blue-eyed, and tell you how unfortunate it was that you didn't inherit your grandparents' light skin.
-When certain sports clubs, dance clubs, shopping stores only allow the entrance of caucasians.
-When someone yells "indio" as an insult.
-When someone makes monkey sounds to make fun of an African-Peruvian.
-When you notice that authority positions in Peru like senior executives, politicians and media personalities are only filled with white people.
-When you ask boys which of the girls is the prettiest in the group and they pick the blondest one. She actually is not that pretty, but they're just following the logic of the whiter the better.

The list could go on.

The sad part its that we haven't shown any progress in this attitude during my lifetime. No policies or plans have been developed to enforce a healthier attitude in our society in regards to how we see race. Billboards still advertise white Peruvians and Quechua speakers continue to be bullied. Its great to be in the age of the internet when every now and again you'll see a video or a news piece where Peruvians speak out about how disgraceful racism is in our country. But it is so unfortunate that that dialogue hasn't extended outside of this platform and into the real world. It is so ironic how in a society where racism is so explicit, we are so afraid to admit it and talk about it in public. I wish there were more people like my father-in-law in Peru. Asking each other questions like "have you been discriminated against?" It does not solve racism, but it would allow us to empathize better and make the issue more tangible. Otherwise it is just "this racism thing" that we discuss in third person, and it makes it less of my own problem, less of OUR problem. It took me a few years in the US to finally have this conversation, but how many years did it take me in Peru? I'm still waiting for it. I might make the effort to ask my father-in-law's question to other Peruvians, but what's the point if they don't feel like giving me the answer. The U.S. still is not the best example of a non-racist society, but I can only hope that my country follows this country's steps to give this problem more coverage in media and to push people to open up for dialogue.
