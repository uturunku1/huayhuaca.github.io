title: What's in my Family Name

Like most women who are about to get married, I found myself in the position of deciding whether or not to change my last name for his. In my case, it was a very easy decision to make because, since I was 15 years old, I had embraced my father’s last name with such pride that I could never picture myself having another last name.

I say 15 years old because when I was younger I was easily embarrassed by my friend’s jokes about my unpronounceable, unreadable last name: H-U- A-Y- H-U- A-C-A. Pronounced: “Why-walk- ah”. And since most last names in Peru are either in Spanish, Italian or German, I was always seen as different, as an Andean that came from a Quechua-speaking family. Only as I grew up did I come to realize how cool it was to be different. I became very well acquainted with the interesting Huayhuaca family history, that nowadays I enjoy talking about whenever I get the chance. Now I find it funny when I see someone struggling to pronounce my last name.

Unfortunately, I don’t carry my mother’s last name and also never got to meet her family. Her family’s name: Uturunku, with such guttural and powerful resonance, was always a mystery to me. I know little about its origins and history. I know its meaning however: Jaguar.

My mother didn’t get to know her father well, neither the Uturunku lineage. Her mom took her away from her dad’s side when she was just a baby. But when she was 13, she snuck away to visit her father in his small hometown, in Cusco, Huarocondo. That was probably one of the most disappointing episodes of her life.

Her mother had always talked about a beautiful shawl that the Uturunku family had passed from generation to generation to the eldest daughters of the family. When my mother went to visit her dad, yes, she was looking to rekindle with him, but also looking for the famous shawl that in theory belonged it to my mom. He bluntly denied it to her. Her dad told her he was going to give it to the daughter he had had with his new wife, the one he had left my grandma for. My mother left his house to never look back again. It took her exactly 46 years to forgive her dad. One day, out of the blue, mother told me, “I want to visit the place where I was born”; I knew what this meant. I had been planning this trip forever, the day I would be taken by my mother to meet the Uturunku family.

On our way to Huarocondo, Cusco, my mother told me how her mom had gotten together with her dad. Andeans have a very reserved, quiet nature, so when my mother said that the way her dad had shown interest in her mom was by gently sliding a little piece of rock next to her feet, and that she had shown interest back by sliding another little piece of rock to his feet, it sounded about right.

It wasn’t difficult to find the family. When we ask people from downtown Huarocondo if they knew where the Uturunku family was, they didn’t hesitate to reply, “On the street they always lived on”. To my surprise, the Uturunku family, for many generations, had always lived on the same street. Funny enough, my mom’s mom’s relatives were also still in the same neighborhood and, as a matter of fact, had married other members of the Uturunku family . Between those two families, they owned four blocks of that small town.

Recently I discovered The Genographic Project, a DNA test to map your family’s ancestry. When I looked at the reference populations that the project has so far, I found that Andean Peruvians have the lowest genetic variation. Or, to put it simply, they are the least mixed human group in the world. They are 96 % Native American and 4% European Mediterranean. This fascinates me, and kind of disturbs me at the same time as we have all heard about the negative side effects of inbreeding.

Nevertheless, I was charmed by this little town where everybody knew each other. With tall majestic Andean hills, acres and acres of green fields, and clean narrow streets with pretty houses made of adobe, I couldn’t imagine a better place to retire. And even though everyone spoke Quechua there, and only my mom only understood what they were saying, I could feel the warm welcome that they were giving us as foreigners. My mother was excited to meet aunts, uncles, and siblings she had never known until then. The only one she didn’t get to say hello was her father. Her half-sister told us that he had passed away four years ago. My mother didn’t cry, but she was disappointed and guilty that she never gotten the chance to make peace with this man.

Soon after that, we head back home, to Lima. We promised our newly met family that we would come back. I know that my mother surely wants to reunite with her “new” family as soon as she retires. And as for me, I know that I still have much more to unravel about my past. I just hope I get the chance to do it sometime in the not so distant future.
