In 2011, I jumped into an airplane in Peru to come to my current home, Portland, Oregon. As a gift to me and my perseverance in adapting to a different culture, I decided to start this blog. From long ago I’ve been wanting to share my humble expat perspective on this exceptional, fast changing country. I’ve always admire the honesty and curious eyes of westerners living in or visiting “exotic” countries, and their stories on bizarre foods and ethnic customs. But, in my opinion, is time to flip the camera and look at what America has to offer to an indigenous Andean girl.
