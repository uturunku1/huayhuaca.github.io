In 2011, I jumped onto an airplane in Peru to travel to my current home, Portland, Oregon. For a while now I’ve been wanting to share my humble expat perspective on this exceptional, fast-changing country. I’ve always admired the honesty and curious eyes of westerners living in or visiting “exotic” countries, and their stories of bizarre foods and ethnic customs. However, in my opinion, it is time to flip the camera around and look at what America has to offer an indigenous Andean girl.
